`Timeline` renders the primary, detailed view of spans.

## Props

```ts
interface TimelineProps {
  className?: string;
  snapToSpan?: boolean; // default false
}
```

- **className**: Add custom CSS classes.
- **snapToSpan**: When selecting or hovering, the indicator can snap to nearby span boundaries for precise alignment.

## Behaviors

- Click a span to zoom to it (with a small padding).
- Click-drag across the header or content to select a window and zoom.
- Hover shows a vertical time line with a tooltip.
- Zoom controls (bottom-right): zoom-in, reset, zoom-out.
- Time markers adjust dynamically based on the current view.

## Example

```tsx
<Timeline className="w-full" snapToSpan />
```
