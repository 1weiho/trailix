## TimelineSpan

```ts
export interface TimelineSpan {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  startTime: number; // ms
  duration: number; // ms
  children?: TimelineSpan[];
  level?: number; // assigned internally when flattened
  metadata?: Record<string, any>; // attach anything you need
}
```

## ColorStyle

```ts
export interface ColorStyle {
  background: string;
  color: string;
  border?: string;
}
```

`levelStyles` used by `TimelineProvider` map colors by nesting level. It's recommended to provide a five-level palette to cover common nested depths.

These types are exported from `trailix` and can be imported directly.
